# NSS E12 Exercise - Product Cards


## Description:
Our first exercise at NSS. The goal of the exercise was to create a grid of product cards using HTML & CSS. I created cards for "Quarantine Essentials." I displayed the cards using flex-box, and used complex-positioning to place the sold-out image over top of the card.
